# Re-learn Python

I used python as my primary programming language several yeas ago. And python is the first programming language I find is both beautiful and powerful.
I became very interested in programming after that, so I learned Haskell, Ruby, Javascript, and some others.

After all those learning, I find myself just 'know' many programming skills, but lacking the in-depth understanding and pratical skills. So I decide to re-learn python, hoping to find a python-related job.

Good luck to me!
